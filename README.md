🚨 Project Update: Hotel Bookings Analysis using SQL 🏨📊

I recently completed an end-to-end SQL project analyzing a real-world hotel reservation dataset. The goal? To uncover insights into guest behavior, pricing strategies, and booking trends — all crucial for data-driven decision-making in the hospitality industry.

✅ Key insights I extracted using SQL:

Most popular meal plan and room types 🍽️🛏️

Year-wise and weekend booking trends 📅

Average prices for families with children 👨‍👩‍👧

Lead time extremes for reservations ⏱️

Top market segments by revenue 📈

Advanced RANK() analysis to rank room types by average price within each market segment 🔍

🧠 This project honed my SQL skills in:

Data aggregation

Window functions

Grouped analysis

Business intelligence reporting
